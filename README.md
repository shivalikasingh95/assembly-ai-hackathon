# Chords & Art - Submission for AssemblyAI Hackathon 

## Chords & Art - Your AI buddy for your Music needs

We're all aware of the tremendous progress made in the generative AI space recently. With our project, `Chords & Art` we have tried to leverage the recent advancements made in this area and applied to the domain of Music.
We thought it'll be extremely useful as well cool to have a project that could help address different needs that someone may have with respect to generation of music -- whether you want to write lyrics for a song, compose music or even generate album cover art for your music piece.
